👋 Hi, welcome to my GitHub profile, I'm Edgar Cruz (@Ecruz950), a Computer Science student at the Illinois Institute of Technology with a passion for problem-solving, algorithms, and software development. 
My current aspiration is to complete my bachelor's degree and land a career as a software engineer working on front/back-end development. 🧑🏽‍💻

Some of my favorite technologies include Dart, Flutter, and Python, but I've also tampered with other languages like C/C++, Javascript, and 
MIPS assembly and am always open to learning new tools and frameworks. 👾
I enjoy working on diverse projects from web and mobile app development to AI-based systems and game development 
that not only solve real-world problems but also improve user experiences.📱

When I'm not coding, you can find me working on my academic projects, volunteering, or exploring ways to integrate tech into everyday life. 
I believe in the power of collaboration, continuous learning, and the impact of well-written code.

Feel free to connect with me at my LinkedIn profile at [www.linkedin.com/in/edgarprofile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edgarprofile/) or email me at edgarcruz950@yahoo.com✨

Let's connect and build something amazing together! 🤝
